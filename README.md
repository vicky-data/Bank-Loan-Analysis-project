# ðŸ“Š Bank Loan Analysis Project
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze financial data, write SQL queries, and build interactive dashboards in Power BI.
It is part of my Data Analytics portfolio to showcase skills required for roles such as Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and Data Scientist.

# ðŸ“Œ Business Problem
Banks face challenges in identifying risky loans, monitoring repayments, and improving approval efficiency.
This project uses historical loan data to answer:

What is the overall loan approval rate?

Which customer segments are more likely to default?

What are the trends in loan performance over time?
